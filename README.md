# Sudoku-Solver
Functional Sudoku game that has an interactive GUI, made using PyGame, that has a solver implemented. I utilized the backtracking algorithm to implement this solver. Once the space bar is pressed in the GUI, the GUI shows each step the backtracking algorithm takes to solve the board.
# What I Learned
* Using PyGame to build a GUI
* Navigating a 2D Array efficiently
